# Applying Advanced TypeScript Definition Patterns

This repo contains the code from my virtual talk, _Applying Advanced TypeScript Definition Patterns_.

The `init` branch contains the initial state the code walkthrough begins at.

This talk was first shared at OpenJS World 2020. The video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/eSGluXA8CEY) on YouTube.

If this talk is shared at future conferences I'll include all updates here in the README.

If something is out of place please feel free to open an issue or send a PR.
